# Basic parsing and simplification
5 * X^0 + 4 * X^1 - 9.3 * X^2 = 1 * X^0
3 * X^0 + 2 * X^1 = 0
1 * X^2 = 1 * X^2

# Reduction to standard form
2 * X^2 + 3 * X^1 - 5 * X^0 = 2 * X^2
4 * X^1 = 2 * X^1 + 1 * X^1 + 1 * X^1

# Degree identification
4 * X^2 = 0
7 * X^0 = 0
0 * X^0 = 0

# Solving quadratic equations (real solutions)
1 * X^2 - 5 * X^0 = 0

# Discriminant = 0
0.5 * X^2 + X^1 + 0.5 = 0

# No solution / Infinite solutions
0 * X^0 = 5
0 * X^0 = 0
